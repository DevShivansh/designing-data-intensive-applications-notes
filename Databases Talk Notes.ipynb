    "(Speaking notes for a talk on database architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are just three properties intrinsic to a database.\n",
    "  * Persistent insert --- You can push data into the database, and expect it to still be there later.\n",
    "  * Persistent read --- You can read data out of the database, and expect it to return the same value as later.\n",
    "  * Delete --- You can delete data from the database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Not included in these properties:\n",
    "  * Transactions --- transactions are thought of as a common database feature. But they are not an intrinsic thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classical transactional databases.\n",
    "  * ACID --- atomic, consistent, isolated, durable.\n",
    "  * Originally invented for the online transaction processing, or OLTP, use case.\n",
    "  * That explains a lot about why these properties, particularly the second one, are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* External data model\n",
    "  * Data is modeled using tables.\n",
    "  * SQL --- Structured Query Language is provided as an abstraction.\n",
    "      * SQL queries reconstruct data of interest by performing joins between tables.\n",
    "      * SQL is what is called a \"declarative query language\". They are designed to look kind of like English sentences.\n",
    "  * Why do you need SQL at all? So that database writing skill is portable between databases.\n",
    "  * Why does it need to be declarative? To hide the details of database internals (the internal data model) from you.\n",
    "  * Why is this useful? Because queries that you write against databases are not immediately executed; instead they are pushed through a query optimizer, which finds ways to speed your query up by using its knowledge of the underlying hardware and software layers.\n",
    "  * SQL says what you want, not how you want. The alternative is imperative - like writing a program.\n",
    "  * Unfortunately this abstraction is a bit leaky, due to vendors implementing things as they like them.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Example transactional databases\n",
    "  * SQL databases are not the same, but their user-facing design is the same.\n",
    "  * SQLite\n",
    "      * File-based.\n",
    "      * No concurrency, only one in-flight request at a time.\n",
    "      * Transactions.\n",
    "      * Limited SQL implementation.\n",
    "      * Open-source.\n",
    "  * Postgres\n",
    "      * Complicated.\n",
    "      * Concurrent.\n",
    "      * Transactions.\n",
    "      * Broad SQL implementation.\n",
    "      * Open-source.\n",
    "  * OracleDB?\n",
    "      * Complicated.\n",
    "      * Concurrent.\n",
    "      * Transactions.\n",
    "      * Broad SQL implementation.\n",
    "      * Closed-source.\n",

    "* Simplest possible database: append to a file.\n",
    "* Simple log-structured database.\n",
    "* Add log merges.\n",
    "* This is Bitcask!\n",
    "* Why are log files good? Append operation is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* More complicated arch: SSLTables.\n",
    "* Use a memcache which supports random order, sorted iteration to write log files that are key-sorted.\n",
    "* Log files are now much faster to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Final architecture: B-trees.\n",
    "* B-trees sort data into pages, which are accessed from previous pages.\n",
    "* B-trees involve random seek-writes, but do not necessitate a log merge process.\n",
    "* So more predictable performance, but worse median write performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL databases use different data models."
