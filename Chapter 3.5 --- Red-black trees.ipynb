    "# Red-black trees\n",
    "\n",
    "* Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They have $O(\\log{n})$ read times, making them highly efficient.\n",
    "* In addition to the properties of a binary search tree red-black trees have the following invariants:\n",
    "  * Each node is either red or black.\n",
    "  * The root is black.\n",
    "  * All leaves are `null` and black.\n",
    "  * If a node is red, then both its children are black.\n",
    "  * Every path from a given node to any of its descendant `null` nodes contains the same number of black nodes.\n",
    "* Redâ€“black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.\n",
    "* Read operations are the same as in binary search trees.\n",
    "* Insert and delete are much more compliated, but still $O(\\log{n})$.\n",
    "* Here's the tutorial I'm following: http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_rbtree.aspx.\n",
